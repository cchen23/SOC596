    "Googleâ€™s NGrams dataset contains word corpuses in different languages, containing data from millions of digitized texts. This dataset was created by processing over one trillion words of text [1], and researchers can use the data by downloading files with specific NGram counts [2] or by using the NGram viewer to see trends for specific NGrams over time [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "[Michel et al 2011](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176) used the Google Ngrams corpus to investigate cultural trends, showing things such as changing usage of irregular verbs censorship of specific authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, others have raised a few criticisms of this approach, pointing to the existence of OCR errors, overrepresentation of scientific content, and the fact that each book receives equal weight regardless of popularity [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly smaller corpus, the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), addresses some of these criticisms. This corpus includes 400 million words from texts published between 1810 and 2009 [6]. It provides the context surrounding each ngram in the corpus and provides information about the representation of each type of text (fiction, magazine, newspaper, or non-fiction) in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comparison of the two corpuses by the creators of the COHA corpus, see [7]. For a response to criticisms of culturomics, see [8]."

    "1\\.\tThe Michel et al study used frequency plots of year ngrams (such as '1883') to show that the use of years' ngrams have decreased faster over time. They use these plots to conclude that we \"forget faster\" as a society. However, critics state that the Google ngrams data contains an overabundance of academic literature, which might render these conclulsions invalid.\n",

The COHA Corpus categorizes texts according to four categories (Fiction, Magazines, Newspapers, and Nonfiction) and provides the percent representation of each category for each year. Can you categories from the COHA database show if the \"forgetting faster\" effect is caused by an over-representation of academic literature?"
